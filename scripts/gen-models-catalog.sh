# models.dev keeps the FULL history of each provider, including retired model ids
# the provider's API now rejects. We can't read "retired" from the data, so we
# drop ids whose last_updated/release_date is older than a per-vendor cutoff.
#
# Cutoffs below were derived by cross-checking models.dev against each provider's
# LIVE /models API on 2026-06-04:
#   anthropic  — retires aggressively; models.dev still lists the 2024 claude-3
#                line (incl. claude-3-7-sonnet, 2025-02) that the API rejects.
#                2025-04-01 drops those and keeps the claude-4.x line + aliases.
#   openai/gemini/openrouter — ZERO stale ids found (these providers keep listed
#                models valid, and openrouter prunes its own), so NO cutoff: a
#                cutoff would only delete still-valid models (e.g. gemini-2.0-flash,
#                gpt-4o). Keys are by zerostack provider name; "0000-00-00" = keep all.
# This is a heuristic snapshot — the authoritative list is always the provider's
# live API, reachable via `/models refresh`. Re-tune when a vendor retires a line.
